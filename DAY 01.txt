DAY 01:
SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE:

1. ONE-TIER ARCHITECTURE
2. TWO-TIER ARCHITECTURE
3. THREE-TIER ARCHITECTURE
4. N-TIER ARCHITECTURE

EACH ARCHITECTURE WILL HAVE 3 LAYER[SERVER]

TYPES OF SERVER:
WEB SERVER
APP SERVER
DATA BASE SERVER


SERVER: 
it takes request from user and send response.
serves services to user.

1. ONE-TIER ARCHITECTURE 
it is Desktop Application.
all 3 layers will be on single place.
EX: VLC

2. TWO-TIER ARCHITECTURE
web & app server will be on desktop and db server will be on internet
Ex: YOUTUBE

3. THREE-TIER ARCHITECTURE
all 3 layers will be seperated

===============================

Linux:


touch file_name --->used to crete a single file

touch f1 f2 f3 ----->used to create multiple files

touch file{1..5} ----->create 5 files at a time


rm file ----->used to remove single file

rm f1 f2 f3 --->used to remove multiple files


rm file{1..5}----->used to remove 5 files 

rm -f *  ----->used to remove all files at a time

mkdir folder1---->used to create a single folder

mkdir f1 f2 f3----->used to create multiple folders


mkdir folder{1..7}----->used to create 7 folders

vim file_name  ----> to add the data with editor

there are three modes in vim
